Observable.</span>\n *\n * ![](delayWhen.png)\n *\n * `delayWhen` time shifts each emitted value from the source Observable by a\n * time span determined by another Observable. When the source emits a value,\n * the `delayDurationSelector` function is called with the source value as\n * argument, and should return an Observable, called the \"duration\" Observable.\n * The source value is emitted on the output Observable only when the duration\n * Observable emits a value or completes.\n * The completion of the notifier triggering the emission of the source value\n * is deprecated behavior and will be removed in future versions.\n *\n * Optionally, `delayWhen` takes a second argument, `subscriptionDelay`, which\n * is an Observable. When `subscriptionDelay` emits its first value or\n * completes, the source Observable is subscribed to and starts behaving like\n * described in the previous paragraph.
